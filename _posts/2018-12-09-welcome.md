Hi,

I am constantly improving my home automation setup and am currently running a RaspberryPi Kubernetes Cluster.
With all the references that I found online, I want to give it a try to also contribute a bit.
Soon you will find here a few articles about how to set up and maintain kubernetes on your raspberry pi cluster as well as how to then run all the containers on it that you need for your home automation project.
