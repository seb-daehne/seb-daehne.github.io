My name is Sebastian Daehne <br>
I am a DevOps Manager working for LogMeIn in Dresden - Germany. My passion is around DevOps concepts and in special around the usage of containers and container orchestration systems (especially Kubernetes) wherever possible.


Besides DevOps I am also interested in photography - checkout my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sebastiandaehne/) page if you like
